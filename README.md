## Overview

The Quiz Generator is a Python-based application designed to create quizzes from a set of pre-defined questions. It leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) to ensure clean structure and modularity. The goal is to help users test their knowledge interactively through a command-line quiz.

## How it Works

1. **Start the Quiz**: Run the `main.py` file to launch the quiz.
2. **Answer Questions**: Each question will be displayed along with multiple-choice answers.
3. **Submit Your Answer**: Input your choice (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c') for each question.
4. **View Score**: At the end of the quiz, your total score will be displayed.
5. **Restart or Exit**: You can choose to take the quiz again or exit the program.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language used to develop the quiz logic and structure.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: For creating reusable and organized code using classes and objects.

## Lessons Learned

Working on this project helped deepen my understanding of:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Learned how to define and use classes to structure the code efficiently.
- **Modular Design**: Broke down the application into separate components like `Question`, `Quiz`, and the main runner script.
- **Code Reusability**: Designed classes in a way that they can be reused or extended in future projects.
- **Logic Flow**: Improved my ability to plan and execute logical flows within a program.
- **User Interaction**: Practiced handling user inputs and displaying real-time feedback.
