Provide Input: Enter the text or paragraph when prompted.

Take the Quiz: Answer the multiple-choice questions generated based on your input text.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used to develop the application.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used to organize and structure the application with classes.

Lessons Learned
Developing this project provided insights into:

Class Design: Creating and structuring classes to handle different responsibilities within the application.

OOP Principles: Applying encapsulation, modularity, and clean code practices.

Code Reusability: Building reusable components that make the code easier to maintain and extend.
